# cgrep - Simple grep tool for Windows
Reimplementation of the Linux grep program for Windows. cgrep is over twice as fast(sometimes) as the grep package from the chocolatey package manager. Currently under development.

## Usage
```cgrep [regex] <input> <output>```
## Building
### Prerequisites
- g++
- make (Optional)
### Compiling
Clone the repo. With make installed, run ```make``` in the root 
of the project. <br />
Without make, you can run ```g++ src\main.cpp src\help.cpp src\grep.cc -Iinclude -o cgrep.exe```
### Running
Run cgrep with ```cgrep [regex] <input> <output>``` where input and output are ascii-based text files. Optionally, cgrep can be run without any output argument provided. This will automatically log to the console
## Testing
### Preqrequisites
- cmake
- wsl (Or Linux)
### Compiling
Run ```cmake -S . -B build``` to build the code and discover tests included in the binary. <br />
Follow with ```cmake --build build``` then ```cd build && ctest```

* Currently there are no tests implemented
